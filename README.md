<h2>For Deployment:</h2>

To save the model, I utilised the TensorFlow.js converters to export it as a JSON file for the model architecture and an H5 file for the model weights. Then, in the JavaScript file, I used TensorFlow.js to load the model and perform predictions using user's local hardware resources.
